# WinUI migration implementation status

2026-09-27; branch `codex/winui3-frontend`. Main and the installed native candidate
are untouched. Migration is active and incomplete.

## Current implementation

- Microsoft WinApp CLI 0.7.0 installed with user authorization. Developer Mode
  enabled with separate explicit UAC approval. Existing .NET SDK reused.
- Official WinUI MVVM template created `src/OverlayFrontend.WinUI`; resolved stable
  dependencies pinned (Windows App SDK 2.5.1). Counter sample removed; this is a
  frontend foundation, not a widget port. Development package registration is
  separate from the existing installed product.
- XAML shell builds with Microsoft WinUI analyzer enabled: zero warnings/errors.
- OS backdrop compositor requires a Windows dispatcher queue. The initial startup
  crash is diagnosed in `artifacts/winui-shell/debug-launch.log`. Fixed using the
  framework's `DispatcherQueue.EnsureSystemDispatcherQueue`, avoiding custom P/Invoke
  or a competing message loop. Frontend then stayed live and exposed Shell.Status
  and Shell.Close through UIA; invoking Close exited normally.
- `WidgetUi.State` selects background/presentation sources from immutable logical
  membership, independent of realization. Its 15 tests pass. This policy component
  does not implement layout, spatial navigation, painting, or animation.
- Feature inventory: [contracts](winui-feature-contracts.md).
- Replaced custom backdrop code with pinned WinUIEx 2.9.3. Basic transparency
  now passes a controlled red/green desktop-background test at three margin
  coordinates. WinUIEx owns the native DWM/message integration rather than a
  copied implementation in our frontend. License retained and packaged.
- The shared script `scripts/Test-WinUiTransparency.ps1` records pixel results and
  screenshots. A real pointer click reached Close after the test. Test PID 22148
  exited; no validation frontend is intentionally left running.
- [Native binding inventory](winui-platform-binding.md) identifies existing ABI
  reuse and the separate View+Menu observer that must also be exported/preserved.

## Failed / unproven gates

The original top-level Window plus transparent SystemBackdrop brush did NOT show the
desktop through the empty margins. Both window and desktop-composited screenshots
show opaque margins. Extending content into the titlebar did not correct this.
An external diagnostic DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea(-1) call returned success but
made the window white; it was not added to production. A subsequent external style
probe did not establish transparency either. Test window PID 11060 was closed
through Shell.Close afterward. This attempt was replaced, not hidden behind a
passing build. WinUIEx then passed the basic alpha proof described above.

The first winapp launch with --output-appx-directory failed registration (missing
appxmanifest.xml); default project-mode deployment succeeded. Revisit a supported
short staging path if package size/path limits require it. No manifest was deleted,
no unpackaged fallback was introduced to suppress the failure.

Raw debug-process sample was roughly 98 MB private / 142 MB working set; this is an
empty-shell observation, NOT a full-product memory comparison or acceptance result.

No controller routing, real widget transport, lazy collection port, native media,
pinned projection, transparent-area input policy, or frame-latency gate has passed.
Do not claim migration readiness based on shell build or source-selection tests.

## Next actions

1. Extend basic desktop-alpha proof to input regions, native media, pinning,
   monitor/DPI changes and recovery. The shell still has a visible DWM outline;
   finish intended chrome policy through supported window APIs. No undocumented
   root surgery or unstable CompositionEngine opt-in as a workaround.
2. Connect existing platform ABI input/activation rather than rewrite it. Prefer
   framework APIs whenever they remove custom code.
3. Connect immutable source selection to real page/item metadata and shared WinUI
   presentation slots; retain cursor membership independently from realized controls.
4. Deliver the real sandboxed Playnite/collection slice, followed by remaining
   migration features and the pre-WIDGE-293 comparison from the plan.

Evidence: ignored `artifacts/winui-shell/` (build binlogs, UIA/launch output, screenshots,
source-reference excerpt) and `artifacts/winui-state/` (focused tests/binlog).

## Controller and external-content foundation follow-up

- `scripts/Build-OverlayPlatform.ps1` builds only the existing ABI v4 DLL. Release
  build and 24-export inspection passed. It neither initializes hardware nor
  installs the copied GameInput redistributable. Third-party ViGEm source emits
  existing encoding warnings.
- `OverlayPlatformClient` now provides exact ABI structs, initialized outputs,
  stdcall imports/callbacks, SafeHandle lifetime and serialized access. Its 15
  focused fake-native tests pass; they cover callback/disposal and failure paths,
  not physical delivery.
- The WinUI input pump and opt-in controller validation page build with zero
  warnings/errors. User authorized stopping native candidate PID 30152; its logs
  were preserved under `artifacts/winui-controller/`. It had no controller-isolation
  command-line flag. WinUI PID 26144 receives connected GameInputVisibleLease frames.
  Physical navigation/single-A/Guide acceptance is pending. Do not run the old
  native candidate concurrently with this controller owner.
- External-surface validation uses WinUI WebView2 with trusted literal animated
  content. Actual screenshots show a XAML button and ContentDialog above the
  external surface. Four scripted checks pass: ready, pointer-open, Escape focus
  restoration, and reopen. The widget-local modal component is NOT implemented by
  this fixture; neither actual playback nor pinning/rounded clipping is proven.
- Packaged desktop launch arguments are consumed from both activation data and the
  process command line. Project-mode winapp launches now explicitly pass
  `-p Platform=x64` after adding a managed project reference.
- Removed the unrelated template systemAIModels capability. The shell exposes only
  x64 until the native boundary gains supported additional architectures.

### Physical controller feedback and activation correction

User reported: Guide hide/show works, but native navigation/A required clicking a
button first. This is a failed controller-native startup gate, not acceptance.
No further physical checks are requested while the user is away.

The validation page previously called Focus during Loaded and ignored failure.
It now queues focus entry after loading/activation/show, verifies the framework
result, and preserves an already focused descendant. Cold-launch automated check
(PID 23444) observed First focused without any click, Right moved to Second,
Enter changed the shared command count to Second: 1. Native status reported
connected GameInputVisibleLease and entry retained. Keyboard automation does not
prove physical controller delivery; keep the original failure open until an
end-to-end native-frame/activation test and later physical acceptance establish it.
The validation process was closed via Shell.Close after checks.

## Controller replay and virtualized collection follow-up

`--replay-controller` now supplies deterministic native-shaped frames through the
same PlatformInputPump/OverlayPlatformSession, actual WinUI focus traversal,
command path and Guide hide/show handler as the live fixture. It does not load the
native DLL or read hardware. Cold focus, Right, one A, hide/show, retained Second
focus and a second A passed with no injected mouse or keyboard. This narrows the
startup-focus check but does not supersede the user's physical delivery failure.

A `KeyedObservableCollection<T>` preserves per-key binding wrappers within a data
generation and emits granular standard notifications. Twelve new state tests pass
(27 combined). Current code does not claim atomic notifications or constant-time
arbitrary reorders. See its README for limits.

`--validate-collection` connects this model to WinUI's higher-level ItemsView with
UniformGridLayout and ItemContainer. No custom virtualizing layout/focus engine.
With 1,000 items, direct visual-tree inspection counted 13 realized containers at
the top and 14 at the bottom. Scrolling reached Item 999, appending reached Item
1029, and payload update changed the existing container's title. These are
functional observations, not frame-time or full-product acceptance.

**Failing regression:** focus Item 0, then send fixture F7 to prepend 30 records
without transferring focus to a toolbar button. UIA retained the same focused
item/container identity but reported it offscreen with zero bounds afterward.
The focused item must remain visible under our cursor contract. Evidence is in
`artifacts/winui-collection/prepend-before.json`, `prepend-after.json`, and
`prepend-search.json`. Investigate documented ScrollView anchoring and keyed
logical index mapping before implementing the admission policy. Do not mark the
collection complete or mask this by invoking ScrollIntoView from a test.

Transport correction: current Playnite is a full-trust application widget, not a
sandboxed worker. Use its real application path for UI parity and a real dotnet
worker (e.g. Clock) for the separate AppContainer proof. Existing managed bridge
facade is reusable but needs typed host effects/media/artwork correlation extensions;
see `winui-widget-transport.md`. Prior plan references to sandboxed Playnite are
not accurate descriptions of its manifest.
A bounded follow-up set ScrollView.VerticalAnchorRatio to 0.5 (documented item
anchoring instead of the extent-edge special case). The same prepend still left
Item 0 offscreen. That experimental setting was removed; it is not a fix.
`anchor-before.json` / `anchor-after.json` retain the result. Next inspect logical
key/index mapping and native ItemsView bring/anchor lifecycle with a repeatable
regression, rather than accumulating unproven scroll settings.
