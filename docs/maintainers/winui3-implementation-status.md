# WinUI migration implementation status

2026-09-27; branch `codex/winui3-frontend`. Main and the installed native candidate
are untouched. Migration is active and incomplete.

## Current implementation

- Microsoft WinApp CLI 0.7.0 installed with user authorization. Developer Mode
  enabled with separate explicit UAC approval. Existing .NET SDK reused.
- Official WinUI MVVM template created `src/OverlayFrontend.WinUI`; resolved stable
  dependencies pinned (Windows App SDK 2.5.1). Counter sample removed; this is a
  frontend foundation, not a widget port. Development package registration is
  separate from the existing installed product.
- XAML shell builds with Microsoft WinUI analyzer enabled: zero warnings/errors.
- OS backdrop compositor requires a Windows dispatcher queue. The initial startup
  crash is diagnosed in `artifacts/winui-shell/debug-launch.log`. Fixed using the
  framework's `DispatcherQueue.EnsureSystemDispatcherQueue`, avoiding custom P/Invoke
  or a competing message loop. Frontend then stayed live and exposed Shell.Status
  and Shell.Close through UIA; invoking Close exited normally.
- `WidgetUi.State` selects background/presentation sources from immutable logical
  membership, independent of realization. Its 15 tests pass. This policy component
  does not implement layout, spatial navigation, painting, or animation.
- Feature inventory: [contracts](winui-feature-contracts.md).

## Failed / unproven gates

The top-level Window plus transparent SystemBackdrop brush does NOT yet show the
desktop through the empty margins. Both window and desktop-composited screenshots
show opaque margins. Extending content into the titlebar did not correct this.
An external diagnostic DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea(-1) call returned success but
made the window white; it was not added to production. A subsequent external style
probe did not establish transparency either. Test window PID 11060 was closed
through Shell.Close afterward. Do not count an API success as alpha proof.

The first winapp launch with --output-appx-directory failed registration (missing
appxmanifest.xml); default project-mode deployment succeeded. Revisit a supported
short staging path if package size/path limits require it. No manifest was deleted,
no unpackaged fallback was introduced to suppress the failure.

Raw debug-process sample was roughly 98 MB private / 142 MB working set; this is an
empty-shell observation, NOT a full-product memory comparison or acceptance result.

No controller routing, real widget transport, lazy collection port, native media,
pinned projection, screenshot alpha comparison, or frame-latency gate has passed.
Do not claim migration readiness based on shell build or source-selection tests.

## Next actions

1. Resolve true supported desktop transparency. Inspect version-matched WinUI/native
   hosting behavior; consider documented DesktopWindowXamlSource/native hosting if
   necessary. Prove pixels against a controlled changing background and separately
   prove pointer delivery/hit testing. No undocumented root surgery or unstable
   CompositionEngine opt-in as a workaround.
2. Connect existing platform ABI input/activation rather than rewrite it. Prefer
   framework APIs whenever they remove custom code.
3. Connect immutable source selection to real page/item metadata and shared WinUI
   presentation slots; retain cursor membership independently from realized controls.
4. Deliver the real sandboxed Playnite/collection slice, followed by remaining
   migration features and the pre-WIDGE-293 comparison from the plan.

Evidence: ignored `artifacts/winui-shell/` (build binlogs, UIA/launch output, screenshots,
source-reference excerpt) and `artifacts/winui-state/` (focused tests/binlog).
